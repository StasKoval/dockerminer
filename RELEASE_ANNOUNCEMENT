        Release 3.1.18 of cpuminer-opt is available for download.


All users are encouraged to upgrade.

cpuminer-opt now supports 32 algorithms on CPUs with at least SSE2
capabilities including Intel Core2 and AMD equivalent. See the
performance chart below for details.

In addition 13 algorithms have optimizations to take advantage of
CPUs with AES_NI for even greater performance, including the Intel
Sandy Bridge (Core-i 2xxx) and AMD equivalent.

New in v3.1.18

  - fixed compile problems with AMD CPUs with workaround, see README.md
    for details.

Recently improved algos:

  - x11gost (sib) optimised:
      +116% AES_NI + SSE2
       +63% SSE2
  - nist5 optimised tor AES_NI & SSE2
      +111% AES_NI + SSE2
       +68% SSE2
  - c11 +57% optimized for AES_NI & SSE2
  - zr5 optimized for AES_NI and SSE2
       +98% AES_NI + SSE2
       +45% SSE2
  - myr-gr optimized for AES_NI, marginal increase in hashrate

Users with non-SSE2 CPUs or whoi want to mine algos not supported by
cpuminer-opt may find cpuminer-multi by TPruvot useful.

The performance chart below is for an Intel i7-6700K @ 4 GHz, 16 GB mem.

Normalization rates have ben added to the chart to help with profit
switching pools. Reference algo x11 = 1.

Due to the peculiarities of some algorithms their performance on other CPU
architectures may not scale equally. Their normalizations rates will also
differ from those listed below. YMMV.

Normalized profitability = algo profitability * normalization rate

Footnotes:
(1) SSE2 rates are simulated in software.
(2) benchmark tested only
(3) CPU architecture not supported for algo. It won't work.
(4) AES_NI Optimization not available for CPU artchitecture. Uses SSE2, slower.
(5) Normalised profitability = algo profitability * norm rate, x11 = 1
Unlisted algos are in an unknown state
